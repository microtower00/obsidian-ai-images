## Configuration
To use this plugin you need OpenAI API keys. You can generate them [here](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) if you don't already have them.
Insert your API key in the plugin settings and you will be good to go!

## Features
While typing in editor mode, select some text you wish to use as a prompt for the generation of an image. You can then use the provided command by pressing ```Ctrl+P``` and searching for 'Generate an image from your text selection'.

A link to the generated image will replace the prompt.
